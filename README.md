# 🐍 Python Code Challenges & Tests

Welcome to my Python repository! This collection includes a variety of coding challenges, algorithmic exercises, and small projects that I’ve tackled during my job hunt. Each folder or script here represents a different problem I’ve worked on — whether it's for practice, technical assessments, or just to explore interesting problems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

You'll find:

- 🧠 Algorithmic challenges
- 📊 Data manipulation tasks
- 🧪 Technical assessments from different companies
- 🛠️ Utility scripts and mini-projects

I’ve kept the code clean and well-commented to make it easy to follow and revisit later. Some of the challenges may be familiar if you’ve gone through common interview platforms (like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.), while others are more unique or custom-made.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliomacr/python.git
cd python
Run any script using:
python3 script_name.py

Some files may require specific Python versions or dependencies — if so, a requirements.txt or inline comment will guide you.
