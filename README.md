# 🐍 Python Code Challenges & Tests for DevOps interviews

Welcome to my Python repository! This collection includes a variety of coding challenges, algorithmic exercises, and small projects that I’ve tackled during my job hunt. Each folder or script here represents a different problem I’ve worked on — whether it's for practice, technical assessments, or just to explore interesting problems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

You'll find:

- 🧠 Algorithmic challenges  
- 📊 Data manipulation tasks  
- 🧪 Technical assessments from different companies  
- 🛠️ Utility scripts and mini-projects  

I’ve try to kept the code clean and well-commented to make it easy to follow and revisit later. Some of the challenges may be familiar if you’ve gone through common interview platforms (like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.), while others are more unique or custom-made. 

It definitely needs better organization and is going to be something in progress.

## 🚀 How to Run

Clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/juliomacr/python.git
cd python
```

Run any script:

```
python3 script_name.py
```

> Some files may require specific Python versions or dependencies — if so, a `requirements.txt` or inline comment will guide you. There are also come Jenkins and Terraform test or questions I have been asked to.
